#  Practical Example 8: Write a Python program to check if a person 
# is eligible to donate blood using a nested if

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
weight = int(input("Enter your weight (in kg): "))

if age >= 18:
    if weight >= 50:
        print("You are eligible to donate blood")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible due to low weight")
else:
    print("You are not eligible due to age")
